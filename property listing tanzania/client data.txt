Hey, my phone number is +255 768 111 263
Email: thabelo.who@gmail.com
I'd like two instagram accounts, the first one is @fumbatown
the second one is @thabelo.04
And please include my linkedin account as well. It is "Thabelo Khoboko"
https://fumba.town/
This is the website that has everything I am selling
The website has all the photos you need, the houses that you should include in my listsings are:
Bustani Villas, Moyoni homes, mwangani apartments, vizazi oasis, and the soul fumba
and the burj Zanzibar
When you go in the fumba town website, you will find everything you need concerning the houses 

I have listed above for you whether it is how many rooms, their prices, how many bathrooms,
 how big they are and everything else. Please use the information from the fumba town website 
because it is actual and factual information about the town

And in the website you're designing for me, please put a rent option at the bottom of the website. 
When my client clicks the "rent" option, it should be a link that directs them to a google form 
that I will make where they can just fillout what they want to rent and what options they have.

What other information do you need me to provide you with?
you can use some of these photos that show the town
please utilise the photos of people as well because they evoke emotions. Emotions sell more than just facts
