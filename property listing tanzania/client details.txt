Hello, I am a sales intern at a company called CPS in Tanzania. 
I am soon to become a sales agent and I need to create my own website where prospects can go ahead and view what we have to offer. 
We have a project called Fumba town, it is a town full of houses like villas, apartments, town houses, resort homes etc. 
For me to get clients, I need to advertise these properties myself and they need to have access to my own website where only I can communicate with them. 
For the professional working on website to know exactly what is needed and what I want it to have, 
I would like to have calls with them over zoom or google meet so that we can design this website daily together.
